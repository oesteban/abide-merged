  "TaskDescription": "Prior to the actual MRI scanning session, children participated in a mock scanning session to Interleavedroduce them to the scanning environment. The mock scanner simulates the most important aspects of the actual scanning session, including the feeling of being within the MR-bore, wearing headphones that plays recorded gradient sounds, and the ability to watch a forward-projected film via a mirror positioned on the head coil. The purpose of the mock scanning session was to provide an introduction to the scanning environment and to offer the opportunity for the child or parent to opt out of the procedure before going to the actual MRI scanner. The children and their parents were asked several questions over their anxiety level and whether they thought it was fun or not. These questions were asked before the mock scanning session, immediately after the mock scanning session, and immediately after the actual MRI scan. If, at any poInterleaved, the child responded to a visual analog scale that they were either too scared or that they found it not at all fun, we stopped immediately and the child was not scanned. Data collection was also stopped based on the parents and researchers ratings of the childs fear along the same visual analog scale; if ratings indicated that the child was too scared data collection was stopped. The children were able to watch a film during the structural MRI acquisition, which was the initial Sequentialuence obtained following the localizer scans. The film and sound was turned off during the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging sequence and the children were asked to keep their eyes closed and to think about nothing in particular.",
